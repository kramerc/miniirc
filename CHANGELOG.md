# Changelog

Format partially copied from [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com).

Notes:
 - I strongly recommend you use the latest version of miniirc, there are major
    bugfixes that are not listed here.
 - This changelog may contain typographical errors, it is still a
    work-in-progress.

## Unreleased

### Added

 - `irc.send()`: `irc.send('PRIVMSG', '#channel with spaces', 'Test message')`
    â†’ `irc.quote('PRIVMSG', '#channel\xa0with\xa0spaces', ':Test message')`

## 1.4.2 - 2019-08-16

### Changed

 - Code style changes.
 - Rewrite the internal socket receiving loop.
 - Use `threading.Lock`s internally when sending messages. If you were using
    outgoing message locks for stability, you no longer need them.

### Deprecated

 - Python 3.4
 - In miniirc v2.0.0, `irc.ns_identity` may be stored as a tuple instead of a
    string, for example `('username', 'password with spaces')` instead of
    `'username password with spaces'`. Both formats are currently accepted and
    will be accepted in the `ns_identity` keyword argument.

## 1.4.1 - 2019-07-16

### Changed

 - Bugfixes and code style changes.

### Deprecated

 - Internal-only attributes `irc.handlers`, `irc.sock`, and `irc.sendq`
    (please do not use these) will be renamed.
 - In miniirc v2.0.0, unspecified hostmasks will be an empty string instead of
    the command. Don't rely on this "feature" if possible, simply ignore the
    hostmask if you do not need it.


## 1.4.0 - 2019-06-18

### Added

 - Allow "channels" to be passed as a string containing a single channel.
 - A `colon` keyword argument to `Handler` and `CmdHandler`. When this is
    `False`, the leading colon is removed from `args[-1]`.

### Changed

 - Minor bugfix.

### Deprecated

 - In miniirc v2.0.0, the `colon` argument will default to `False` instead of
    `True`.

## 1.3.3 - 2019-05-20

### Changed

 - Bugfixes and a minor performance improvement.

## 1.3.0 - 2019-04-28

 - Catch-all handlers that can handle all events.

## 1.2.4 - 2019-04-06

### Changed

 - Bugfixes.

## 1.2.3 - 2019-04-06

*Although miniirc v1.2.0 to v1.2.2 existed, they were horribly broken and
pulled from PyPI. Changes from those releases will be mentioned here.*

### Added

 - miniirc now periodically pings servers, the interval at which this ping is
    sent can be modified with the `ping_interval` keyword argument.
 - The `ns_identity` keyword argument can now be a `tuple` or a `list` similar
    to `('username', 'password with spaces')`.
 - The `debug` keyword argument can be a function, this will be called for each
    line displayed with `irc.debug()`.

### Changed
